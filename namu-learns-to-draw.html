        <h3>From the Author:</h3>
        <p>My daughter Namu is really a gifted artist. She started drawing at a very early age. And as a first-time mother, I was so obsessed with her drawings that I used to save all her artwork whether it came from the daycare, or something she would draw after listening to a story, watching a cartoon, after having any experiences or anything she would draw in her school.</p>
        <p>Since I had a huge collection, I wanted to share it with the world so that they can get some ideas and get their kids started on a similar journey. It's not just about drawing, it is about any passion that any child may have. It could be recording small and beautiful moments of their life, for example - when they first started playing a musical instrument, started writing, learning a language or picking up multiple languages. Not every child is the same, but one thing I am sure everyone will agree with: "Every child is gifted." We just have to be open-minded about it and wait patiently to see what is special for our child.</p>
